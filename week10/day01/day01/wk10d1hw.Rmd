```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
project <- read_csv("data/project_management.csv")
```



Plot the data, taking estimated_length as the independent variable and actual_length as the dependent variable.
```{r}
project %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = actual_length, y = estimated_length)) +
  geom_point()

```

Calculate the correlation coefficient of estimated_length and actual_length and interpret the value you obtain.

```{r}
project %>% 
  summarise(corr_coefficient = cor(actual_length, 
                                   estimated_length))
```
The correlation coefficient is 0.8047.  This is a 'very strong' positive correlation


Perform a simple linear regression using actual_length as the dependent variable, and estimated_length as the independent variable. Save the model object to a variable.
